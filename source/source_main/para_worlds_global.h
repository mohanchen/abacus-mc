 * into one esolver_world per image, and an images_world inter-communicator
 * connecting ranks with the same rank_in_esolver across images. Only these
 * two domains are registered for now; finer domains (pools/diag/rgrid) are
 * still produced by the legacy Parallel_Global path and will be migrated in
 * later steps.
 *
 * With nimage = 1 the esolver_world is a duplicate of MPI_COMM_WORLD, so the
 * existing downstream decomposition on MPI_COMM_WORLD stays bit-identical.
 *
 * Must be called once during startup (from the driver). Calling it again is a
 * programming error and aborts via WARNING_QUIT.

 * @param[in] my_rank  rank of this process in MPI_COMM_WORLD
 * @param[in] nimage   number of images to split into (must be >= 1)
