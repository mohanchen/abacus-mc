# abacuslite

## Introduction

abacuslite is a lightweight plugin for ABACUS (Atomic-orbital Based Ab-initio Computation at UStc), implementing the ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment) calculator interface.

### Key Features

- **Lightweight Design**: Implemented as a plugin, no need to modify ASE core code
- **Version Compatibility**: Supports ASE versions satisfying the package requirement `ase>=3.22`
- **ASE Integration**: Uses ASE as the running platform, making ABACUS a callable calculator within it
- **Function Support**: Provides SCF-based energy, force, and stress evaluations through ASE. ASE can use these evaluations for relaxation, molecular dynamics, NEB, band-structure, and density-of-states workflows.
- **Socket Support**: `AbacusSocketIO` provides fixed-cell i-PI socket calculations, with energy always available and forces/stress enabled independently when requested.

## Installation

Install the plugin from the ASE interface directory:

```bash
cd interfaces/ASE_interface
pip install .
```

## Usage Examples

Please refer to the example scripts in the `examples` folder. Recommended learning path:

1. **scf.py** - Basic SCF calculation example
2. **relax.py** - Atomic position relaxation calculation
3. **cellrelax.py** - Cell parameter relaxation calculation
4. **bandstructure.py** - Band structure calculation
5. **dos.py** - Density of states calculation
6. **md.py** - Molecular dynamics simulation
7. **constraintmd.py** - Constrained molecular dynamics simulation
8. **metadynamics.py** - Metadynamics simulation
9. **neb.py** - Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) calculation
10. **soc.py** - Noncollinear spin-orbit coupling calculation
11. **socketio.py** - Fixed-cell ASE optimization with `AbacusSocketIO`, running ABACUS as an i-PI socket client

The regular `Abacus` calculator runs one ABACUS calculation for each ASE property evaluation. ASE controls the relaxation, molecular-dynamics, and other workflow steps. The socket calculator reuses one ABACUS process for position updates, while the cell and electronic-structure settings remain fixed for that calculator instance.
